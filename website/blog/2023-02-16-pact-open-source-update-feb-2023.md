Welcome all, it‚Äôs February, we are live, and this is another update from the Pact Open Source team.

## Let‚Äôs Pact Party like it‚Äôs 1999
  
2023 marks a special celebration for Pact, 10 years since the first commit brought it to life.  

![first commit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19932401/202204239-f2bfa18e-5ff3-450a-b037-8d0a5cc5387d.png)

Read more about the history to date [here](https://docs.pact.io/blog/2022/11/17/pact-facts-a-history-lesson#the-birth-of-pact-ruby)
  
We intend to celebrate that fact with the people who helped make it great, the community, its maintainers and advocates. We want to help make it an experience that you won‚Äôt forget, but we also want it to help bring in new contributors and ideas to the field.

## Getting involved with Pact  

We have ‚ù§Ô∏è for all our contributors and maintainers ‚Äì we have reached the heights of today because of the hours and work many people have put into the Pact ecosystem.  

Getting involved with an open source project ‚Äì Pact or otherwise ‚Äì [can be extremely rewarding](https://docs.pact.io/contributing#why-get-involved-in-open-source-anyway) and allow you to give back to a community in a meaningful way. If you‚Äôre passionate about Pact, you can find a way to get involved [here](https://docs.pact.io/contributing#pact---how-you-can-help).

That's all for now, catch you next month!
