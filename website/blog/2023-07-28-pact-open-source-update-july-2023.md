:wave: Hello, its July, it's scorching so I hope you've got an ice cream to accompany you this episode or maybe a brolly if you are stuck in a rain-shower!

For the keener of our readers, you may note we missed our June episode. I was on holiday ( a rare treat! ) which was spent mainly away from the keyboard,
with the exception of a little flurry in pact-python.

Never fear, a double-dose of Pact Open Source updates are here!

### Pact-Net

The PactNet 5.0 RFC is complete with PactNet [5.0.0.beta.1](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-net/releases/tag/5.0.0-beta.1) now released.

This bring in the ability to generate V4 Specification Pact's using the same API as V3 sync and async pacts and utilise combined pact files for both http and message based interactions. This removes the limitation requiring services which comprise of both http and message-based interactions to be named differently.

See the [migration guide for upgrading to PactNet 5.x](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-net/blob/master/docs/upgrading-to-5.md)

### Pact-Go

Pact-Go V2 has officially been released, following an extended beta period. We are very grateful to our many early users who provided invaluable feedback.

You can check out the full release notes [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

and for those migrating from v1, you can check out the migration guide [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/blob/master/MIGRATION.md)

This update replaces the pact-ruby core, with the pact-rust core, utilized through the pact_ffi library, bringing support for V3 and V4 Pact specifications and the ability to load pact-plugins to extend the capabilities of pact-go.

- Supported platforms.
  - Linux x86_64 / arm64
  - MacOS x86_64 / arm64
  - Windows x86_64

Please note that Alpine Linux is not supported at this time.

#### New Features

- [support binary bodies in async plugin messages #302](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/pull/302) fixes [ContentType being set as application/json for protobuf messages #265](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-go/issues/265)

### Pact-JS

JavaScripters/TypeScripters/Nodemads

We listened to our community, who struggled with requiring python to install pact-js in order to get at that lovely rust pact-core functionality in pact-js v10 & v11 and pact-js-core v13

You can now find they both come fully charged with batteries included, meaning that supported platforms can use pact js v12 and pact-js-core v14 with `--ignore-scripts true` and no additional install time build requirements

- Supported platforms.
  - Linux x86_64 / arm64
  - MacOS x86_64 / arm64
  - Windows x86_64
- [Migration notes](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/blob/master/MIGRATION.md#11xx---12xx)
- Troubleshooting
  - [Failed to find native build](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#failed-to-find-native-build)
  - [Failed to find node:path](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#enoent-no-such-file-or-directory-open-nodepath)
  
In addition, the new releases now support versions of Node 16 and greater, CI testing has been dropped for earlier versions, and we explicitly set the `engines` value in the `package.json` of both `pact-js` and `pact-js-core` to honour this restriction. We would advise updating your projects to an in support LTS version, (Node 18 LTS is probably most sensible at this point and node 16 is due to EOL on 11th Sept 2023)

- [Pact-JS v12 Release Notes](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/releases/tag/v12.0.0)
- [Pact-JS-Core v14 Release Notes](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-core/releases/tag/v14.0.0)

#### New Features

- Support for eachKey and eachValue matchers has been added to pact-js via [pull #1303](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/pull/1103) which closes [issue #952](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/issues/952)

### Jest-Pact

[Updated to reference peer-dep of pact-js 12.x](https://github.com/pact-foundation/jest-pact/pull/242)

### NestJs-Pact

[Updated to reference peer-dep of pact-js 11.x and nest-js 10.x](https://github.com/pact-foundation/nestjs-pact/pull/47)

### Pact-Broker

Pagination support was added via [pull #622](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/pull/622)

You can find the current documentation and supported endpoints [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/blob/master/docs/api/PAGINATION.md)

A few performance enhancements were made at the same time.

- [add contract_data_updated_at to integrations table to speed up dashboard query](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/pull/617)
- [add method to automatically determine the model associations required to be eager loaded for a decorator](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/pull/621)
- [add schema for pagination query parameters](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker/pull/620)

Whats next for Pact-PHP?

Oh Hi FFI :blobwave:

[#326 Support for V3 / V4 + Plugins Via FFI](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-php/pull/326)

#### What is the current status

Pact-PHP does not currently support v3+ features of the rust core, in the mainline branch. 

V3+ features are now available for beta testing in `ffi` branch, in a view to stabilise and release into the mainline.

We would ❤️ your support

#### How can I test this today

Anyone can start testing `pact-php` with `pact_ffi` code by updating their `composer.json`

`"pact-foundation/pact-php": "dev-ffi as 10.0.0"`

- [Migration Guide](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-php/blob/ffi/UPGRADE-10.0.md)

#### How can I submit feedback

All feedback is gratefully received, positive feedback is great, as it allows us to ascertain how well the package is doing for users. Constructive criticism is okay too, but see the next section

- Reply in this issue
- Raise a new issue, clearly stating you are using the `ffi` branch

#### How can I contribute

If you want to help improve Pact-PHP, read the [`DEVELOPING.md`](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-php/blob/ffi/DEVELOPING.md) documentation, fork the repo and have a play!

### Pact in the community

#### Pact-graph-network

We [mentioned](https://docs.pact.io/blog/2022/11/17/pact-2022-end-of-year-wrapup#dec) Guillaume Camus's pact-graph-network tool back in December. It's just [been updated](https://github.com/ManoManoTech/pact-graph-network/releases/tag/v0.8.0) to support multiple target architectures, and [now supports authentication mechanisms](https://github.com/ManoManoTech/pact-graph-network#usage) whether you have a basic auth protected Pact Broker, or a Bearer token protected PactFlow Broker.

So what are waiting for? Go forth and generate some broker charts, and why not share us your graphs via https://twitter.com/@pact_up or pact-slack.

## Hello Jo

I imagine you've heard of [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), the testing tool, not the veggie, If not, Cucumber is a tool for running automated acceptance tests guided by a technique called BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development), written in plain language called Gherkin. It has strong overlaps with our principles of contract testing and the Pact DSL, and is often part of a development teams tool-set alongside Pact for developing robust, quality systems. The similarities don't end there, it also has a thriving community which has been spearheaded by Jo Laing, across [Slack](https://cucumber.io/docs/community/get-in-touch/) and in [many events](https://cucumber.io/resources/) across the globe.

That leads us nicely into what has Jo been up to this week!

Jo volunteered at AgileConf Scotland, where she was tasked with speaker support duties for a workshop.

A principles-based approach to create test automation strategies that work at scale, hosted by none other than [Antonello Caboni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonellocaboni/) (a Pact community speaker) & [Nicola Sedgwick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasedgwick/) (a former CukenFest speaker). It's a smöl ol' world.

The penny dropped as slides for contact testing appeared and Jo had to declare her new role in the Pact community.

<p style={{textAlign:"center"}}><div><img src="https://github.com/pact-foundation/docs.pact.io/assets/19932401/1f28383e-eadf-4bf6-814a-7f6457aaa279" alt="jo_anton_agilescotland" width="450" height="300"/></div></p>
<br/>

So that leads me to announce to you, that I have the pleasure of inviting her to join me in my role as community shepherd, and know she will be helping to bring some organisation to the fold, including things like maintainer sessions and training, she has worked on the [Cucumber school](https://cucumber.io/school/) which is an incredible free resource to help those learn about BDD, I would :heart: a Pact School - if such a thing would float users boats.

## Community Corner - Olivier Picaud

Autonomy within development teams is really valuable, tied with standardisation and goverance in an organisation, it can empower your teams. However it isn't all roses, it can also lead to fragmented tooling across the landscape, especially when developing microservice-based architectures in the dream of multiple protocols and languages all working in harmony. The landscape is always moving quickly but we are going to shine the spotlight on how open-source, both in terms of its tools, its users and contributors are helping to push things forward.

gRPC makes it easier to build high-performance microservices by providing generated service entrypoints in a variety of different languages. Bazel complements these efforts with a capable and fast polyglot build environment. Pact now offers the ability to test gRPC
services via its extensible plugin mechanism, and it complements both gRPC and Bazel well, affording engineers the confidence to build applications in a stable repeatable manner, all whilst gaining that rich feedback from contract-testing.

We caught up with [Olivier Picaud](https://github.com/opicaud), who felt the draw, and utilised the power of open-source not only to power his journey of learning, but to share his progress, so that others can follow along. You can find his pull request showcasing his work [here](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/255)

>To learn monorepos, i put in place some grpc microservices using pact to validate interactions.
>Also, to facilitate the monorepo building, i am using Bazel and so i "bazelify" protobuf-plugin and pact-reference to get a >pact_verifier_cli and protobuf-plugin compiled from source --> Today, local consumer/provider testing is working well.

>From Docker (and then from Kubernetes) i am trying to use the image you provide https://hub.docker.com/r/you54f/pact_verifier_cli, with the addition of protobuf-plugin from Bazel :) (still currently in dev)

>EDIT1: Docker is not used anymore, it has been replaced by OCI images

>EDIT2: Tests are not running from Docker images anymore, but directly from the build via pact_verifier_cli and pact-protobuf-plugins. To ensure a deterministic build, pact_verifier_cli and pact-protobuf-plugin are compiled "just in time" during build process (or use cache if already built).

>EDIT3: Idea for the community : providing a "rules_pact" Bazel rule --> to use directly Pact from Bazel projects with pact_verifier_cli and other Pact tools as embedded toolchains ?

>See here:

>- https://github.com/opicaud/pact-reference (fork)
>- https://github.com/opicaud/pact-protobuf-plugin (fork)
>- https://github.com/opicaud/monorepo

>What I learned and still learning is :

>- improving cohesion of teams by pulling them in a monorepo structure
>- improving local development and determinism by providing one tool and the necessary toolchains for different platforms coming with the monorepo --> pact-reference and pact-protobuf-plugin was "bazelifed" for this purpose
>- optimizing test strategy (and notably with pact-grpc) to provide enough confidence to just run health checks when products are deployed.
providing an unique pipeline to build / test / release and deploy using gitops magic monorepo's components in less than 10 minutes to accelerate feedback (incremental builds are amazed for this purpose)
>- I am currently migrating to bazel 6.0 because they use a new way of dealing with dependencies and then i will need to realign my fork to your master to pull out few updates that you made guys :) and then continuing to provide an end-to-end flow (i do not have an cli for instance to "play" with the entire product)

>It's also very nice to participate to the community, i've participate to few others bazel-project by testing PR, providing feedback and red tests :)

Thanks Olivier for taking the time to share with us. It's exciting to hear about pull requests dropping in other areas outside of Pact as part of this effort. I hope this empowers others to take on journeys of discovery through code, through collaboration, as that is how our open source ecosystem is enriched.

Are you using Bazel in your organisation? Are you building tooling on top of pact-reference? Why not let us know! We could bring it into the codebase as part of an external builds directory as suggested by [Ron](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference/pull/255#issuecomment-1467264412) so don't by shy!

## Pactober
